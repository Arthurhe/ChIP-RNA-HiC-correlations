downloaded the "Post-alignment and Duplicate Filtering Data" txt.gz file from GSE63525(liberman cell)

the format is 
read_name    strand1    chromosome1    position1    fragment-index1    strand2    chromosome2    position2    fragment-index2    mapq1    mapq2
where
read_name = the name of the read pair as seen in the FASTQ files
strand = the strand that the read maps to (0=forward, 16=reverse)
chromosome = the chromosome that the read maps to ([1-22,X,Y,MT] for human (b37 reference genome) or [chr1-chr19,chrX,chrY,chrM] for mouse (mm9 reference genome))
position = the position on the chromosome that the read maps to
fragment-index = the index of the interval demarcated by restrictions sites in the genome, starting with 0 for the interval preceding the first restriction site
mapq = the mapping quality score returned by BWA 

the homer intake format is (for summary.txt)
Hi-C Summary Format (columns):
1. Read Name (can be blank)
2. chromosome for read 1
3. positions for read 1 (5' end of read, one-indexed)
4. strand of read 1 (+ or -)
5. chromosome for read 2
6. positions for read 2 (5' end of read, one-indexed)
7. strand of read 2 (+ or -)

Process GSE63525 file to fit HOMER standard:

rm GM12878_summary.txt
